Hello, glad you found my ramblings!

A bit about my background and tools, without being overly verbose (can you tell I have worked in clojure and go?):
- languges: JS/TS((P)React, Vue), C/C++ Go, Clojure, SQL, HTML/CSS
- dbs: Postgresql, Redis
- tools: nix, tmux, neovim, docker/docker-compose, (sometimes) VSCode

In addition, I am Christ follower in the growing house church movement, a husband to a lovely wife (definitly married up!),
all around nerd, and apsiring brewer/farmer (though I am only able to learn about farming this point).

I hope you find these posts valuable, whether you are reading posts about technical subjects, spirituality, or brewing beer.

Feel free to send me an email of you'd like to get in touch!
