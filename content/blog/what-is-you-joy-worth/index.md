I read a really interesting [article](https://repeller.com/trap-of-turning-hobbies-into-hustles/) posted on HN.

In short, the author argues about evaluating if you really need to turn a passion/project/hobby into
a business or "side hustle", and the possible downsides (with some examples) of doing so.

I highly recommend a readthrough and afterwards devote some time to thinking deeply about
joy is in your life (if at all), if your joy is temporal or transcends circumstance, and if
short term or long term joyful/joyous pursuits are forfeited for the sake of pursing monetary or earthly benefits in
both the short and long term.

Take a walk or go where you can be alone. Think deeply, and think for yourself.

If you are a Christian, pray for the Holy Spirit to guide your discernment of earthly pursuits. I trust the Spirit
will lead you in discerning pursuits which take away from you knowing God more intimately and from living life
in contradicition to how Jesus taught to live and view the world.
